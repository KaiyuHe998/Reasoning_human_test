''' Memory stream system, 
# Each observation is named as an memory_piece 
# Memory stream is a container of such pieces and can retrieve these memory piece when needed effificiently
# Task:
  1, store memory_piece and: (1)create embeddings (2)assign importance scores using different metircs 
  2, organize information (3)perhaps do some pre-classification
  3, retrieve memory (4)retrival efficiently (5) reflect and form high level concept according to topics
